# SeeBus
*This tutorial assumes you already have Python 3, pip and (if you wish) a means of creating virtual environments installed on your machine. If you do not, [this tutorial](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) can help*

Clone the repository to your machine and navigate to the root directory of our project.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CS3398-Luna-Sea/SeeBus && cd SeeBus
```

Install all the necessary python packages (it is recommended that you do so in a virtual environment).
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To poll the DoubleMap API for bus ETAs (not yet implemented in our website), run
```bash
python backend/poll_api.py
```

To see raw information from the DoubleMap API of currently active buses in the command line, run
```bash
python backend/bus_tracker.py
```

To see our website, navigate to [seebus.net](https://seebus.net) and accept any warnings about site security (our site is safe, but the HTTPS certificate is not recognized because we did not pay for it).

To see information about us, click the [about](https://seebus.net/about.html) button on the sidebar.

To see the live list of buses, click the [data](https://data.seebus.net) button on the sidebar. We did not have time for formatting or cleaning of the table. All of the information we have calculated on the buses is displayed.
